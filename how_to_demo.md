# How to Demo

1. say what you’re gonna do, then do it, then say what you see
2. don’t multitask: either speak *or* act
3. take your hands off the keyboard when answering a question
3. don’t assume the user can see the cursor
4. make eye contact
5. practice!

# Say what you see

"A picture is worth a thousand words..."

... but it's a different thousand words for each viewer!

So try to be clear about describing what you see.

Good: "So after I click the submit button, you'll see a spinny animation for a second... `<click>` There it is! `<click>` ... and now the next page is loaded."

Bad: "`<click>` Did you see that spinny?"

# Macro to Micro

* Start with a high-level description
* *What* is the goal? *What* is the problem? *Why* do we care?
* Recall the user story:
    * "As a \___, I want to \___, so that \___."
* Then dive in to *how* to accomplish the goal

# Silence is Golden

> "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt."

* Sometimes people don't really *start* listening until there is silence.
* Let your point sink in. Silently count to three (while making eye contact) before moving on.
* When asking the audience a question, silently count to five before answering it yourself. 

> Awkward silences are **great** for eliciting feedback and gathering information. The audience members will feel awkward too, and will want to fill the void.

# It's not a party until something gets broken

>...and it's not a demo unless something goes wrong

Relax. Make a self-deprecating joke. Take a deep breath. Remember that the audience is on your side.

# Answering Questions

* Let the questioner finish
    * Don't cut them off! Keep nodding and let them finish their thought.
* Repeat the question 
    * or at least acknowledge its claims
* Thank the questioner
* Don't be defensive!

# Team Demos

* Only one person speaks at a time
* Clear handoff from one speaker to the next
* One person speaks; another drives
* Don't let one team member hog all the speech time or answer all the questions
